# Disentangled Explanations of Neural Networks via Relevant Subspace Analysis (Demo Code)

This repository provides a minimal demo code for our paper "Disentangled Explanations of Neural Networks via Relevant Subspace Analysis". 


We provide the demo code in `./notebooks/demo.ipynb`.


## Setup

We use Python version 3.8.6 or higher. We provide a list of necessary dependcies in `requirements.txt`. One can install them via

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Please run the unit test command below to check that necessary functionalities work.
